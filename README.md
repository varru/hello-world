My First Encounter with GitHub

This is Varun, came here late in the game of learning GitHub tool, but better late than never.

My first change on the read me file in a branch :)

Few things about me :
I like to read and listen books when i am on the go, have interest in finance and non-fiction.
Love programming, like being challenged by some interesting and complex problems(in computers or in general).
Like to learn dance when in mood, try out new food and cook.
Liek to refresh my science knowledge when i get some time
Runner(25K best run so far)

I am here to start my journy as a lerner and contributor.
